## Introduction

Some words on the backgorund of your projects.
Which plants did you select and why ?

## Material & Methods

### Sample collection

Nine samples chosen from the Rosaceae family were collected from the Botanical Garden of the University of Fribourg (link): *[Malus pumila](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/208861725), [Malus sylvestris](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/208861749), Malus floribunda, Prunus cerasifera, Prunus padus, Prunus tomentosa, Potentilla sterilis, Potentilla rupestris, Potentilla recta*. These samples were collected for the DBGI project and were registered accordingly on iNaturalist. More details for the nine samples are available [here](link the csv file). 
Leaves were collected using a sterilized scalpel and placed into coffee filters. The coffee filters were individually placed in a 50mL Falcon tube prior to drying of the leaves in a freeze dryer for one week.
