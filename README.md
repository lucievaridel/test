## Introduction

Some words on the backgorund of your projects.
Which plants did you select and why ?

## Material & Methods

### Sample collection

Nine samples chosen from the Rosaceae family were collected from the Botanical Garden of the University of Fribourg (link): *[Malus pumila](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/208861725), [Malus sylvestris](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/208861749), [Malus floribunda](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/208861702), [Prunus cerasifera](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/208861819), [Prunus padus](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/208861835), [Prunus tomentosa](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/208861852), [Potentilla sterilis](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/208861803), [Potentilla rupestris](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/208861779), [Potentilla recta](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/208861763)*. These samples were collected for the DBGI project and were registered accordingly on iNaturalist. More details for the nine samples are available here (link observations files). 
Leaves were collected using a sterilized scalpel and placed into coffee filters. The coffee filters were individually placed in a 50mL Falcon tube prior to drying of the leaves in a freeze dryer for one week.

You can link a csv that you upload on github.
Go to the export link of the DBGI project on inaturalist https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/export?projects=digital-botanical-gardens-initiative
Apply eventual filters (fo rexample by username)
Save the csv and upload to github.

### Sample preparation

For each specie ~50mg (**Table 1**) of the dried leaves were weighted in a 2mL Eppendorf and grinded using metallic beads in a Retsch grinder (2.5min, 25 Hz). 1.7mL of a solvent mixture of 80% methanol, 20% water and 0.1% formic acid were then added. The sample was then centrifugated (2 min, 13’000 rpm). The cleared supernatant was then collected for storage at -80°C. 120µL aliquots were taken to inject in the LC-MS. A quality control (QC) was prepared with a mixture of all the nine samples in equal parts. A blank was prepared with the extraction solvent mixture.

|Specie                     |Weight|
|---------------------------|------|
|Malus pumila               | mg|
|Malus sylvestris           | mg|
|Malus floribunda           | mg|
|Prunus cerasifera          | mg|
|Prunus padus               | mg|
|Prunus tomentosa           | mg|
|Potentilla sterilis        | mg|
|Potentilla rupestris       | mg|
|Potentilla recta           | mg|


### LCMS Analysis

All samples with the blank and the QC were measured in a Liquid Chromatography coupled to a Mass Spectrometer (LC-MS). The Liquid Chromatography was performed with a Reversed phase C18 column. The LC conditions are available [here](https://github.com/commons-teaching/SBL.20004.2024/blob/main/lc_conditions.txt). The Mass Spectrometer had an Electrospray ionization source and the mass analyzer/detector is an orbital ion trap. The MS conditions are available [here](https://github.com/commons-teaching/SBL.20004.2024/blob/main/ms_conditions.txt).
